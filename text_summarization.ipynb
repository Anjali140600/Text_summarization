The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \\nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \\nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders.

During the last \\nfive years, I had an opportunity to present colours to many regime nts, participate in \\nnumber of passing out parades, meet the troops who were going to undertake  peace \\nmissions and interact with the family members of our Defence F orces. Our Defence \\nForces are in a beautiful mission. When the nation sleeps during night , Members of our \\nDefence teams are awake to guard us and remain vigilant to counte r any threat. The \\nNation cherishes the valour, commitment and devotion to duty of our Defenc e Forces. \\nSimilarly, I had opportunities to interact \\nwith members of our para-military forces, central and state poli ce personnel including \\ninternal security forces who are making immense contribution in au gmenting the safety \\nand security of our citizens under difficult conditions. \\n \\nYouth movement for Developed India 2020 \\nRecently, in Hyderabad, I met a group of citizens who are putting i nto practice the motto \\nof transforming of our youth into enlightened citizen.

This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \\nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \\nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \\nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \\nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \\n \\nEmpower Villages \\nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \\noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \\nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \\nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \\nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \\nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \\nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \\nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \\ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \\nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \\nsocieties. \\n \\nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \\nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \\nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \\n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \\nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \\neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \\nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \\nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \\nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \\ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \\nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \\nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic development model for the \\nwhole region. \\n \\nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \\nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \\nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \\ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \\ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \\nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \\nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \\ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \\nPURA being established in many states. The whole country needs 7000 PU RA to \\nbridging the rural – urban divide. \\n \\nSeed to Food: Backbone for agricultural growth'),\n",

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \\nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on “Agri culture Cannot Wait”, I \\nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \\nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \\nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \\n“Seed to Food” since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \\nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution.

His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \\nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \\nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \\nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \\nI could do for him? He said, “I don’t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \\nof you”. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a’s pancha ratna kriti \\nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite touched. \\nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \\ncould blossom in this \\nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \\nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \\ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \\ntheatre. \\n \\nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \\nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \\nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \\n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \\nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \\nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely damaged. \\nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. The villagers apprised me of \\ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \\nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \\ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \\nallowing problems to become their master.

      "A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's departing speech from the Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2007 highlights his gratitude to the people of India and the various groups that supported him during his five-year tenure. He shares 10 key messages to accelerate the country's development, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Empowering villages and rural areas\n",

      "\n",
      "During his speech, he shares a personal anecdote about a young girl, Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. This question reflects the desire of the youth to live in a developed India, a sentiment echoed by over 15 lakh youth whom he has met, representing the dreams of the 540 million youth of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this goal, Kalam emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and rural areas. He shares a personal experience from his visit to Nagaland in 2002, where he met the tribal village council members and witnessed the empowered village council functioning with financial powers. He notes that this model has the potential to transform the 600,000 villages of India, if all villages are empowered and well-connected with urban societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "He highlights an initiative by the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has created a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This complex provides three connectivities - physical, electronic, and knowledge - leading to economic connectivity, resulting in large-scale employment generation and creation of numerous entrepreneurs with the active support of 1000 self-help groups. The villagers have successfully developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, engaging in activities such as cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing, and running marketing centers, showcasing a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the Periyar PURA villages have worked with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative ability of the people and enabling them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products.

      "\n",
      "Kalam also emphasizes the importance of sustainable agricultural growth, highlighting the need for a \"Seed to Food\" approach that focuses on empowering rural communities to produce their own food, generate income, and develop entrepreneurship capabilities. He shares his experience of meeting over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories, who evinced interest in innovative agricultural practices. He notes that agriculture is the backbone of the nation and that the principle of \"Seed to Food\" can help double agricultural production with reduced land, water resources, and manpower, thereby improving the economic conditions of the nation.\n",

      "A.P.J. Abdul Kalam's departing speech from the Rashtrapati Bhavan in 2007 highlights his gratitude to the people of India and the various groups that supported him during his five-year tenure. He shares 10 key messages to accelerate the country's development, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Empowering villages and rural areas\n",
      "2. Mobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness\n",

      "9. Harnessing the potential of youth for a developed India\n",
      "10. Accelerating development through the aspirations of the youth\n",
      "\n",
      "During his speech, he shares a personal anecdote about a young girl, Anukriti, who asked him why India couldn't become a developed nation before 2020. This question reflects the desire of the youth to live in a developed India, a sentiment echoed by over 15 lakh youth whom he has met, representing the dreams of the 540 million youth of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "To achieve this goal, Kalam emphasizes the importance of empowering villages and rural areas. He shares a personal experience from his visit to Nagaland in 2002, where he met the tribal village council members and witnessed the empowered village council functioning with financial powers. He notes that this model has the potential to transform the 600,000 villages of India, if all villages are empowered and well-connected with urban societies.\n",
      "\n",
      "He highlights an initiative by the Periyar Maniammai College of Technology for Women, which has created a PURA (Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This complex provides three connectivities - physical, electronic, and knowledge - leading to economic connectivity, resulting in large-scale employment generation and creation of numerous entrepreneurs with the active support of 1000 self-help groups. The villagers have successfully developed 200 acres of waste land into cultivable land, engaging in activities such as cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal, and medicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing, and running marketing centers, showcasing a sustainable economic development model for the region.\n",
      "\n",
      "Moreover, the Periyar PURA villages have worked with experts from Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) to develop internationally competitive prototypes for 55 lifestyle products, enhancing the innovative ability of the people and enabling them to develop and produce internationally acceptable products. This cooperative venture has the potential to be replicated across the country, with a need for 7000 PURA complexes to bridge the rural-urban divide and empower the 600,000 villages of India.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also emphasizes the importance of sustainable agricultural growth, highlighting the need for a \"Seed to Food\" approach that focuses on empowering rural communities to produce their own food, generate income, and develop entrepreneurship capabilities. He shares his experience of meeting over 6000 farmers from different states and union territories, who evinced interest in innovative agricultural practices. He notes that agriculture is the backbone of the nation and that the principle of \"Seed to Food\" can help double agricultural production with reduced land, water resources, and manpower, thereby improving the economic conditions of the nation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, Kalam highlights the significance of international collaborations, such as the Pan African e-Network, which aims to connect 53 African countries with seamless and integrated satellite, fiber optics, and wireless networks. This initiative includes:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Connecting 12 universities (7 from India and 5 from Africa) for collaborative research and education\n",
      "- Establishing 17 Super Specialty Hospitals (12 from India and 5 from Africa) for telemedicine services\n",
      "- Creating 53 telemedicine centers and 53 tele-education centers in Africa\n",
      "- Commissioning a pilot project on tele-education and telemedicine in Ethiopia\n",
      "- Offering an MBA course for 34 Ethiopian students through Indira Gandhi National Open University\n",
      "\n",
      "This international effort demonstrates Kalam's commitment to empowering communities, promoting education, and providing access to healthcare across the globe.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam also emphasizes the importance of defending the nation, highlighting the bravery and dedication of the Indian Defence Forces, including soldiers, sailors, and air warriors. He shares his experiences of visiting various military installations, including the KUMAR station in Siachen Glacier, and interacting with Defence personnel, para-military forces, and police personnel.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, Kalam highlights the transformation of the youth through initiatives such as the Lead India 2020 Foundation created by Dr. N.B. Sudershan at Hyderabad. This foundation aims to transform youth into enlightened citizens through training programs, with visible impact on students from Medak district, who have shown self-discipline, love for their parents and teachers, and recognition of their duties towards the nation. The foundation's mission-oriented program has ignited the minds of the 540 million youth below the age of 25, which Kalam considers the most powerful resource on the earth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Kalam concludes by emphasizing the importance of preserving the rich and diverse treasures of India's culture and civilization for future generations. He highlights the country's natural resources, progress in the last sixty years, and the power of its 540 million youth as key factors that will help India become a developed nation well before 2020.
